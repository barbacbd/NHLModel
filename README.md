# Survival Analysis

Survival Time - number of seconds until a goal occurs in a single game

Censored data - Sometimes a goal is not observed by a team during the course of a game. Since the event of interest (goal) was not observed, the data is considered censored. In this case we will not observe the end of survival time (in a single game), this is called right-censorship.

## Survival Function

S(t) = Pr(T > t)
t - represents the number of seconds into the game.
